## Entry Points for Contributors

**Start anywhere. Fork freely. No permission needed.**

### Story Entry Points

- Write a chapter from the perspective of the 'Library'—the grove itself—as it experiences the fire and the first touch of the new chief's healing.
- Create the story of the messenger: his journey from the coast, what he witnessed at the Library, and the visions that now haunt him.
- Draft a 'found document': a colonial officer's field report attempting to rationally describe the 'living archive' and the inexplicable failure of the fire to destroy it completely.
- Write a scene where Kofi's sister, Esi, uses a form of knowledge from the grove (e.g., a specific plant's property, a bird's migratory pattern) to solve a critical crisis for the village.

### Technical Entry Points

- Build an interactive map of the Seven Hills region, where users can click on geographical features (the grove, Lake Bosomtwi, the trade path) to reveal layers of ecological data, historical lore, and character perspectives tied to that place.
- Design a 'Knowledge Web' visualization tool that models the non-linear, symbiotic relationships between the story's concepts: Chief/Stool, Grove/Library, Rain/Blessing-Curse, Kente/Map, Earth/Water Covenant.
